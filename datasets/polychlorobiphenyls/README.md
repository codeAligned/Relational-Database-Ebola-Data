# 209 polychlorobiphenyls (PCB)

Source: http://www.moleculardescriptors.eu/dataset/dataset.htm

The data set is constituted by 209 polychlorobiphenyls (PCB).
The following properties are given, both in Excel format (PCB_Properties.xls)
and in a tab-delimited text format (PCB_Properties.txt):

1) melting point (MP)
2) relative retention time (RTT)
3) octanol-water partition coefficient (logP)
4) total surface area (TSA)
5) log Henry constant (logH)
6) log water solubility (logSw)
7) log water activity coefficient (logYw)
8) relative enthalpy of formation (dHf)

A set of 106 molecular descriptors (topological descriptors) is also given, both
in Excel format (PCB_Descriptors.xls) and in a tab-delimited text format
(PCB_Descriptors.txt).
