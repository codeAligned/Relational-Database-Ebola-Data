The data set is constituted by 209 polychlorobiphenyls (PCB).
The following properties are given:

1) melting point (MP)   
2) relative retention time (RTT)  
3) octanol-water partition coefficient (logP)  
4) total surface area (TSA)  
5) log Henry constant (logH)  
6) log water solubility (logSw)  
7) log water activity coefficient (logYw)  
8) relative enthalpy of formation (dHf)  

Unknown values are identified by -999.

A set of 106 molecular descriptors (topological descriptors) is also given, both in Excel format (PCB_Descriptors.xls) and in a tab-delimited text format (PCB_Descriptors.txt).

The descriptors are calculated by DRAGON software (version 5.4). 
The whole list of descriptor labels and meanings is collected in the file Descriptor_Label_List.txt and Descriptor_Label_List.xls.
