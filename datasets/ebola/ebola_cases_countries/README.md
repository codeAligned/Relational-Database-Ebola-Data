Methodology: Data are based on official information reported by
ministries of health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing
reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory
results. The fewer cases reported this week compared with the Situation Report
of 29 October is due to a change in the use of data sources. In this report, the
cumulative total numbers of cases and deaths nationally and by district are
identical to those presented in situation reports compiled by ministries of
health and WHO country offices. Previously, these totals were derived from a
combination of patient databases and country situation reports. The revised
approach unifies the totals presented in this report with those given in
national reports.

Caveats / Comments: The WHO sitrep provide updated data for countries with
an active Ebola outbreak. The WHO declared Senegal, Nigeria, Spain United States
of America, Mali, the United Kingdom, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guineato be
Ebola free on 17 October, 20 October, 2 December, mid December 2014, 18 January
2015, 10 March 2015, 9 May 2015, 7 November 2015 and 29 December 2015
respectively. Although not reported in the sitrep, the cumulative figures from
these countries are presented in the dataset for convenience. On 14 November
2014, Liberia has fewer deaths than the last update on 12 November due to
reclassification. Data are based on official information reported by ministries
of health, through WHO country offices. These numbers are subject to change due
to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of
laboratory results.
