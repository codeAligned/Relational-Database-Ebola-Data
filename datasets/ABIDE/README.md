Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), are characterized by qualitative impairment in
reciprocal social communication, as well as by repetitive, restricted, and
stereotyped behaviors. Previously considered rare, ASD are now recognized to
occur in more than 1% of children, causing immense suffering to individuals and
their families. The complexity and heterogeneity of ASD make it necessary to
obtain large-scale samples which are difficult to attain in any individual lab.
In response, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) hereby provides
previously collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(R-fMRI) datasets from 539 individuals with ASD and 573 typical controls for the
purpose of data sharing in the broader scientific community. This grass-root
initiative involved 16 international sites, sharing 20 samples yielding 1112
datasets composed of both of MRI data and an extensive array of phenotypic
information common across nearly all sites (see below). This unprecedented
effort is expected to facilitate discovery science, and comparisons across
samples.

In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project /
INDI protocols, all datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information
included.
